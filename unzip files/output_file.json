Unless otherwise stated in the marking guideline, penalties for foreign items are applied only if the \ncandidate is not losing marks elsewhere in the question for that item (no penalty for misplaced item). \nNo double penalty applied.  \n2. Penalties for place ment or poor presentation (e.g. details) are applied only if the candidate is earning \nmarks on the figures for that item.  \n3. Full marks for correct answer. If answer incorrect, mark the workings provided.  \n4. If a pre -adjustment figure is shown as a final  figure, allocate the part -mark for the working for that \nfigure (not the method mark for the answer). Note: if figures are stipulated in memo for components of \nworkings, these do not carry the method mark for final answer as well.  \n5. Unless otherwise indi cated, the positive or negative effect of any figure must be considered to award \nthe mark. If no + or – sign or bracket is provided, assume that the figure is positive.  \n6. Where indicated, part -marks may be awarded to differentiate between differing qualities of answers \nfrom candidates.  \n7. This memorandum is not for public distribution, as certain items might imply incorrect treatment. The \nadjustments made are due to nuances in certain questions.  \n8. Where penalties are applied, the marks for that se ction of the question cannot be a final negative.  \n9. Where method marks are awarded for operation, the marker must inspect the reasonableness of the \nanswer and at least one part must be correct before awarding the mark.  \n10. Operation means 'check operation'. 'One part correct' means operation and one part correct. Note: \ncheck operation must be +, -, x, ÷, or per memo.  \n11. In calculations, do not award marks for workings if numerator & denominator are swapped – this also \napplies to ratios.  \n12. In awarding method marks, ensure that candidates do not get full marks for any item that is incorrect \nat least in part. Indicate with a . \n13. Be aware of candidates who provide valid alternatives beyond the marking guideline.  \n14. Codes: f = foreign item; p = placement/presentation.  \n \nThese marking guidelines consist of 16 pages.
